# Q-Variance Challenge

Can any continuous-time stochastic-volatility model reproduce the exact one-parameter parabolic relationship  
σ(z) = √(σ₀² + z²/2)  
across 200+ assets and all horizons 1-26 weeks with R² ≥ 0.92 and ≤ 2 free parameters?

Quantum baseline (Orrell 2025): R² ≈ 0.95  

Repository contains:

- Scoring engine
- Live leaderboard
- Baseline quantum fit

AI and machine-learning entries explicitly encouraged.

Launching January 2026 — details soon.
