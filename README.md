# Q-Variance Challenge

<img src="Figure_1.png" width="800">

Can any continuous-time stochastic-volatility model, using no more than three free parameters, reproduce what may be the most **clear-cut empirical property of variance**, namely the parabolic relationship known as **q-variance**?

This states that, for a sufficiently large data set of stock prices, variance is well-approximated by the equation

$\sigma^2(z) = \sigma_0^2 + \frac{(z-z_0)^2}{2}$

where $z = x/\sqrt{T}$, and $x$ is the log price change over a period $T$, adjusted for drift (the parameter $z_0$ accounts for small asymmetries). The figure above illustrates q-variance for stocks from the S&P 500, and periods $T$ of 1-26 weeks. Blue points are variance vs $z$ for individual periods, blue line is average variance as a function of $z$, red line is the q-variance curve. 

Q-variance affects everything from option pricing to how we measure and talk about volatility. Modelling volatility without it is like modelling the arc of a cannonball, not as a parabola, but as a straight line plus noise (not recommended). Read the [Q-Variance Wilmott paper](Q-Variance_Wilmott_July2025.pdf) for more details and examples.

To take part in the challenge, use your model to produce a long time series of simulated price data, and score it as described below.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains:
- Parquet file in three parts containing price data for 352 stocks from the S&P 500 (stocks with less than $\sim 25$ years of data excluded)
- Full dataset generator `data_loader.py` to show how the data was generated
- Baseline model fit `baseline/baseline_fit.py`
- Figures showing q-variance and R² value for the actual data
- Dataset generator `code/data_loader_csv.py` to load a CSV file of model price data and generate a parquet file
- Scoring engine `code/score_submission.py` for your model
- Jupyter notebook `notebooks/qvariance_single.ipynb` showing how to compute q-variance for a single asset

The dataset used as a benchmark is for 352 stocks from the S&P 500, with periods T of 1–26 weeks.  

Columns: ticker (str), date (date), T (int), sigma (float, annualized vol), z (float, scaled log return).

Due to file size limitations, the dataset parquet file is divided into three parts. Combine them with the command:
```python
df = pd.concat([pd.read_parquet("dataset_part1.parquet"),pd.read_parquet("dataset_part2.parquet"),pd.read_parquet("dataset_part3.parquet")])
```

Python dependencies: pip install yfinance pandas numpy scipy matplotlib pyarrow

## Scoring the Challenge

The challenge scores submissions on **one global R²** over the **entire dataset**. Since the q-variance parabola with $\sigma_0=0.255$ and $z_0 = 0.02$ gives a near-perfect fit (R² = 0.998) this curve can be used as a proxy for the real data. In other words, the aim is to fit the two-parameter parabola, using **up to three parameters** – must be easy, right?

To get started, first simulate a long price series using your model, and save as a CSV file with a column named 'Price'. Then use `data_loader_csv.py` to compute the variances $\sigma^2(z)$ for each window and output the `dataset.parquet` file. The benchmark file has around 3 million rows, so you want a long simulation.

Next, use `score_submission.py` to read your `dataset.parquet` (must match format: ticker, date, T, z, sigma). This will bin the values of $z$ in the range from -0.6 to 0.6 as in the figure, and compute the average variance per bin. It also computes the R² of your binned averages to the q-variance curve $\sigma^2(z) = \sigma_0^2 + (z-z_0)^2/2$.

The threshold for the challenge is R² ≥ 0.995 with no more than three free parameters. The price-change distribution in $z$ should also be time-invariant, so the model should be independent of period length $T$. If your model doesn't tick all the boxes, please enter it anwyay because it may qualify for an honourable mention.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Is q-variance a well-known "stylized fact"?

A: No, a stylized fact is a general observation about market data, but q-variance is a **falsifiable prediction** because the multiplicative constant on the quadratic term is not a fit, it is set by theory at 0.5. The same formula applies for all period lengths T. As far as we are aware this is the most clear-cut and easily tested example of a model prediction in finance.

Q: Has q-variance been previously reported in the literature?

A: Not to our knowledge, and we have asked many experts, but please bring any references to our attention. If anyone has made the exact same prediction using a model then we will announce them the winner.

Q: Is q-variance a large effect?

A: Yes, the minimum variance is about half the total variance so this is a large effect. If you are modelling variance then you do need to take q-variance into account.

Q: Does q-variance have implications for quantitative finance?

A: Yes, classical finance assumes a diffusive model for price change, but q-variance is a marker of a different kind of price dynamics that is shaped by transactions. Standard formulas such as Black-Scholes or the formula used to calculate VIX will therefore not work as expected.

Q: How does q-variance vary over different time periods, or from stock to stock?

A: In theory the curve should be time-invariant, though in practice there is a small degree of variation, see [Figure 2](Figure_2.png). The results for individual stocks are of course noisier and have a different minimum volatility as shown in [Figure 3](Figure_3.png), but taking the average variance over a number of stocks smooths out this noise. You can experiment further using the [Qvar Shiny app](https://david-systemsforecasting.shinyapps.io/qvar/).

Q: Is q-variance related to the implied volatility smile?

A: Yes. It is not the same thing because q-variance applies to realized volatility – but if you want to model implied volatility, a first step obviously is to understand realized volatility.

Q: Is q-variance related to the price-change distribution over a period?

A: Yes, it implies that price-change follows the q-distribution which is a particular time-invariant, Poisson-weighted sum of Gaussians (see further reading below). [Figure 4](Figure_4.png) compares the q-distribution with the average distribution over the S&P 500 stocks, where the distribution of each stock has been normalized by its standard deviation for comparability. The time-invariance is illustrated in [Figure 5](Figure_5.png) for different periods $T$. If your model matches q-variance and is time-invariant then it should produce the q-distribution.

Q: Why should I enter this competition?

A: For fun, an intellectual challenge, kudos ... but also because, if your existing model of price behaviour doesn't do q-variance, then it is missing important market structure.

Q: Can I use AI for the challenge?

A: Yes, AI-assisted entries are encouraged. We used Grok to help design and code the challenge. Its [entry](submissions/grok_rough_vol) is a modified rough volatility model which achieves an R² of 0.986, however it does use four parameters and also is not time-invariant. The aim is to find a process which can achieve better results with fewer parameters.
