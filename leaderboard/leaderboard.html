Instability of this distribution (variance is undefined) means that the model does not reliably converge. Note that adjusting a parameter like shape factor to match q-variance by theory is treated the same as adjusting it empirically, because in either case the model is being adjusted to fit a desired result." },

Advantage of these models is they converge to q-variance in theory over very long times, problem is that if stocks behaved like this you would never see q-variance except on average over centuries of data." },
